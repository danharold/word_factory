## Word Factory

- You are responsible for planning the stock for a word factory
- There are around 28,000 English 8-letter words
- Fortunately for you, our factory only makes 105 of them
- Each day, for a working week (5 days) one (of the 105 words) will be ordered
at random from the factory
- You need to make sure you have the stock on the shelf to make that word

<b>Your Mission: </b>

Maximise the profit you make for the factory in the week

<b>The Rules:</b>
- Each successfully completed word sells for £20,000
- Failing to supply a word costs you a £10,000 contractual penalty
- Each letter held in stock costs £1,000
- Every letter used when a word is sold will be replaced at the end of the day,
costing £1,000 to restock (i.e. - you only need to hold enough stock for one day)
- You may express ship in 1 additional letter per day to help you make your 
word - this letter will cost you £3,000 and will NOT be restocked
